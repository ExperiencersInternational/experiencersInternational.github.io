# Take a screenshot: the guide
##### 19th January 2023

Taking a screenshot is pretty useful, especially in these 'guides' since they allow you to see what you're expecting, albeit I've done a horrible job at this so far ðŸ˜‚.

## Instructions

I will note right now that you're not going to see anything for Mac, iOS or most Linux distributions. Please pop over a message on my Mastodon if you'd like to help write this tutorial for those devices.

### Windows 10 and 11 (from 1909?)

Somewhere in the lifecycle of Windows 10, Snip and Sketch was introduced as a modern replacement to the Snipping Tool application and it's incredibly easy to take a screenshot if you have it set up correctly (albeit I hate how Microsoft changed the behaviour towards saving in Windows 11).

1. Find the item you want to screenshot and press Windows key + Shift + S. You'll be launched into the snipping menu.
2. At the top of your screen, you will find options for full screen, window, freeform or standard cropping, choose the one that's best for your case.
3. a. If you're using freeform or standard, you'll need to find where you want to start cropping, and hold down your left mouse button until you've moved your mouse to where you want to end cropping.
3. b. If using windowed, simply left click on a window.
3. c. Full screen automatically takes a screenshot as soon as you click on its icon
4. You've taken a screenshot, to access them, open Notifications and find a notification from Snip and Sketch, you're then able to do what you want with the screenshot.

In Settings, you can also configure this to Print Screen if you prefer, but it means screenshotting functions in a specific app might not work properly.

### Windows Vista to Windows 10 (pre 1909?)

1. Find the item you want to screenshot and open Start
2. Use a search box if provided and look for 'Snipping Tool'
3. Open the application, and use the drop-down in New to configure what type of cropping you want
4. Step 3 from the previous tutorial applies here
5. Your screenshot will now appear on your screen and you can do what you wish with it

### Linux Mint

1. Press Print Screen, or if that doesn't work, hold Shift as well
2. You'll likely be launched into a freeform snipping tool, again, Step 3a from the first tutorial applies here
3. You should see a screen with your screenshot and options to copy to clipboard and save

### Android (general) (non TV)

1. Find the item you want to screenshot and press the Volume Down and Power buttons
2. You've now taken a full screen screenshot, depending on your skin, you should see options to edit, share or print it as soon as you've taken it

### Android (MIUI, EMUI and a few others potentially)

This may need to be enabled in Settings, look for a 3 finger screenshot option.

1. Find the item you want to screenshot and place three fingers on your screen and swipe down
2. You've now taken a full screen screenshot

### Android (MIUI) freeform

Enable this first by going into Settings > Additional > Gesture shortcuts > Partial Screenshot and turn the toggle on.

1. Find the item you want to screenshot and place three fingers on your screen and hold them until you see a menu with snipping options
2. Choose between standard, freeform or using a circle and use one finger to drag from the starting to the end point of your screenshot.
3. Readjust your screenshot if needed and click Save
4. You've now created a freeform screenshot
