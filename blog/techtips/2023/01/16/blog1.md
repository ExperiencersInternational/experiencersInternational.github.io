# Windows Shortcut List
##### 16th January 2023, last edited 19th January 2024

Do you use a lot of shortcuts? It's alright if you don't, but here's a list of every shortcut on your Windows PC (Windows + something).

If you can download it, PowerToys, which works on Windows 10 and newer, is a Microsoft developed app with some great tools, and one of them is telling you about these shortcuts, it may come in handy some times.

I cannot guarantee all of the information is accurate, particularly with the operating system requirements, but there may be some other inaccuracies here.
