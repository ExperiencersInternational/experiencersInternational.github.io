# Backup a hard drive using Linux Mint
##### 16th January 2023

Believe it or not, I'm writing this guide as I'm doing it, but I want to provide a quick guide on how to backup a hard drive using Linux Mint, particularly 20.2 in my case.

This guide should work from an installation or a live CD.

## Backup

1. Turn on Linux Mint
2. Open the launcher and open Disks
3. Plug in the disk you want to back-up
4. Select the drive from the sidebar
5. Select the 3 dots in the titlebar
6. Press 'Backup Disk Image'
7. Give your disk image a name that you'll be able to recognise, and save it to your desired location
8. Wait for it to process, and once it's finished, you will now have backed up your disk

## Restore a backup

1. Turn on Linux Mint
2. Open the launcher and open Disks
3. Plug in the disk you want to back-up
4. Select the drive from the sidebar
5. Select the 3 dots in the titlebar
6. Press 'Restore Disk Image'
7. Find your disk image that you saved through the file selection menu and press Restore
8. Wait for it to restore, and once it's finished, you will have restored from a disk image

## Conclusion

This is a really handy feature, I'm currently using this to backup a drive that I used for my Wii U which has saves on it. Wouldn't need to go through this if Nintendo backups to the cloud, but they don't.
