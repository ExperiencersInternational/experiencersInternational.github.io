You like music right? If you're like me, you have a local library, and you don't rely on Spotify or any other similar services (I use YouTube Music purely to upload my music, this is one of the previous guides I have made).

## The guide

### Part 1: Find your songs lyrics

Yeah, go onto Google and find the lyrics of your song first of all, you can usually do this by searching '[artist name] [song name] lyrics'. An example is attached below.

Copy all of those lyrics to your clipboard, and proceed onto the next part.

### Part 2: Sync those lyrics up!

Head over to [https://lrc-maker.github.io/](https://lrc-maker.github.io/) into your browser, and follow the instructions below.

1. Press the upload button at the bottom, and attach the song that the lyrics are for.
