# Dump flipnotes from Flipnote Studio and Flipnote Studio 3D as a video
##### 5th February 2023

Flipnote Studio has to be one of the most nostalgic applications on the DSi. Sure it wasn't nostalgic on the 3DS, since it wasn't pre-installed and you had to save up My Nintendo points but you also couldn't download the DSi version (unless you're modded and willing to find pirated Flipnote Studio CIAs).

Anyways, with that out of the way, this tutorial will tell you on how you can dump your Flipnotes from both games, and change it from the propietary file formats that Nintendo uses.

You could just get Flipnote Hatena working through Sudomemo, but ideally, we probably don't want everyone seeing our old cringy Flipnotes, right?

## Requirements

- Nintendo DSi/DSi XL (LL)/3DS/3DS XL (LL)/2DS/New 3DS/New 3DS XL (LL)/New 2DS XL (LL)
- An SD card (or microSD for New 3DS/New 2DS models)
- A device that can read SD cards and has access to the internet

## The guide

This guide assumes that all your Flipnotes are already on your SD card, but if not, you should take the time to open Flipnote Studio or Flipnote Studio 3D and transfer them.

1. Power off your system and take the SD card out of it
2. Insert the SD card in your SD card reader
3. Open the drive where the SD card is located and navigate into `/private`
4. a. For Flipnote Studio, open `/ds/app`. After that, open `/4B475556` if in Europe/Australia, `/4B475545` if in America, and `/4B47554A` if in Japan. Then, simply navigate to `/001` and copy all `.ppm` files over.
4. b. For Flipnote Studio 3D, open `/Nintendo 3DS/app`. After that, open `/JKZP` if in Europe/Australia, `/JKZE` if in America, and `/JKZJ` if in Japan. Then, navigate to all the folders and copy all `.kwz` files over. Due to Flipnote Studio 3D having folders, these folders will follow any names of folders you've set in the app.
5. After copying everything over, open up a web browser and navigate to [https://flipnote.rakujira.jp/](https://flipnote.rakujira.jp/).
6. Click the Browse Files box, find the `.ppm` and `.kwz` files you copied over and select them. Unfortunately, you can only select one at a time, so you'll have to repeat for every Flipnote.
7. A page should open with your Flipnote, click Convert and change the video scale to 4x for maximum quality. Change the output file name if needed and press Convert again.
8. A prompt should come up to download, once you've downloaded, you now have your Flipnote saved as an MP4!
9. Repeat from Step 6 for any additional Flipnotes.

## Conclusion

This is a really great way to backup your old Flipnotes, in 4x resolution as well which equates to around 960p (at least for Flipnote Studio 3D).
