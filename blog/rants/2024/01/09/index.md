# Why did we let the headphone jack get removed?
##### 9th January 2024

Last night, I decided to use my wireless earphones to listen to some music as I was trying to cut my music library down (I have around 8GB of music at the moment on my phone's SD card and I really need to move this all to internal storage since my SD is slow because it's a class 4 card).

Whilst I was using them, I eventually heard it moaning about low battery after an hour (i think it was on roughly 50 or 60% charge when I used it) and it's inspired me to make this rant because wireless headphones suck.

## Battery life sucks when using wireless headphones

The first thing that I find with wireless headphones is that the battery life sucks. I don't know whether it's like this for all devices, but I think mine must last roughly 4 hours. It's not a particularly long time in all honesty.

The battery life on your phone will also suffer from wireless headphones. I don't personally know how much wired uses when connected to your phone (since you have to power it somehow right) but it's almost certainly less than wireless. With wireless headphones, you have to obviously enable Bluetooth and transmit audio wirelessly, which probably takes a tax on your phone's battery.

## Wireless headphones interfere with WiFi signals

In case you don't already know, Bluetooth signals can interfere with WiFi signals since they use the same 2.4GHz frequency. I haven't noticed it make a big effect on this device, but it might be because my device supports WiFi 5 2.4GHz and 5GHz, meanwhile my previous one probably supported WiFi 4 2.4GHz.

If the signals interfere, it may mean that loading stuff through WiFi takes an extremely long time (when I was using the phone that had problems with the internet, we were using at least 50mbps internet and probably 100mbps later on, now I get 260mbps though).

## Quality sucks compared to wireless headphones

Before I continue on further, I need to stress that I'm not an audiophile.

On wireless headphones, the maximum bitrate supported tends to be much lower than wired headphones. Depending on the codec, it may have more of an effect on some combinations compared to others.
