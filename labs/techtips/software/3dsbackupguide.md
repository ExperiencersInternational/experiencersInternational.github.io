# Backup your 3DS games (the guide)

With the Nintendo eShop closing in 28 days from the writing of this guide, let me show you on how to back your games up.

**NOTE: This assumes that the latest version of Luma3DS is installed on your device, and you have GodMode9 on your console. Follow 3ds.hacks.guide to mod your 3DS if you haven't.**

## The guide

### Backup a cartridge game [DS/DSi enhanced/DSi games]

Not writing a guide on how to reinstall, but just throw the files in the /sd/roms/nds folder when done and open Twilight Menu to play it.

1. Turn on your 3DS, holding START as you turn it on
2. If GodMode9 asks you to set the time, do so now
3. Press GAMECART using Up and Down on your D-Pad and pressing A when you're hovering over it
4. Find the file that has 'trim.nds' on the end of it and press A when hovering over it
5. Navigate to the option on your bottom screen that says something like Dump NDS
6. This process will take a few minutes, and when done, your game will be in SD/gm9/out

### Backup a cartridge game [3DS games]

This guide will show you to backup a cartridge game in the CIA format. There's no real point to back-up as the default 3DS file, and CIA files make it easier to reinstall.

1. Turn on your 3DS, holding START as you turn it on
2. If GodMode9 asks you to set the time, do so now
3. Press GAMECART using Up and Down on your D-Pad and pressing A when you're hovering over it
4. Find the file that has 'trim.3ds' on the end of it (e.g. 0004000000086400_v00.trim.3ds for a PAL version of Animal Crossing New Leaf (non WA update) and press A when hovering over it
5. Navigate to the option on your bottom screen that says NCSD image options and press Build CIA from file
6. This process will take a few minutes, and when done, your game will be in SD/gm9/out

### Backup a digital game or game DLC/update [3DS games]

1. Turn on your 3DS, holding START as you turn it on
2. If GodMode9 asks you to set the time, do so now
3. Press the HOME button and select Title Manager
4. Select SD card
5. Navigate to the game or DLC/update that you want to dump
6. To help differentiate between updates, DLC and games, take a look at the bottom screen, and at the start of the title ID, there will be certain codes for DLC, updates and games. For updates, it is 0004000e, for DLC, it is 0004008c, and for games, it is 00040000.
7. Press A when you've found what you want, and press Build CIA (standard). **NOTE: For digital games, Citra, which is a 3DS emulator, recommends pressing Dump CXI/NDS file instead, but I don't know whether you can install CXI files through FBI.**
8. This process will take a few minutes, and when done, your game will be in SD/gm9/out

### Backup save data (not sure this works with DS games)

**NOTE: The restoring process is similar, but please note that restoring a game's save data requires that you have created save data for the game already.**

1. Turn on your 3DS and wait until the Home Menu appears
2. Open the Checkpoint app on your 3DS, and find the game you want to backup
3. Press A and then press backup
4. Give it whatever name you want, it doesn't matter, and within a few seconds, it should be backed up

### Reinstall your games [3DS games]

1. Turn on your 3DS and wait until the Home Menu appears
2. Open the FBI application on your 3DS
3. Press SD Card
4. Then, navigate to /gm9/out
5. You should find your backed up games here, press A on one and click Install
6. Wait a few minutes and your game should be installed
7. This same process also applies to update files
