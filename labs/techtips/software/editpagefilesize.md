# Edit your page file size in Windows

In today's guide, here's a guide on how to edit your page file size (otherwise known as virtual memory and swap file) in Windows. A page file is essentially some extra RAM, but it lives on your hard drive.

## The guide

This guide is written for Windows Vista or newer, but you might have to use an alternative way to access it in XP or older.

1. Press Start on your computer's desktop and start typing 'Adjust the appearance and performance'. This should hopefully result in a search result being adjust the appearance and performance of windows.
2. Click on this result
3. Press Advanced in the menu
4. You should hopefully see a section titled virtual memory with the amount of storage, there should be a button in this section, click on it
5. Windows automatically adjusts your page file, you should start by clicking the radio button for setting manually
6. I'd recommend setting a minimum of 2GB (2048MB) for the minimum size on the boot drive
7. Set a maximum of at least 8GB (8192MB) (I personally have mine set to around 20GB) for the maximum size on the boot drive 
8. Press the Set button, then Apply and OK
9. You should be prompted to restart your computer the first time that you do this, this will apply the changes you've made
10. You've now adjusted your page file size

## Conclusion

You've now adjusted your page file! This can be incredibly useful if you run demanding software such as Yuzu and Cities Skylines.
