# Enable Voice over LTE and WiFi Calling with no option available in settings.

I hate to say this, but this guide is for Xiaomi devices only. If you have any working guide for other manufacturers, contact me on @experiencersinternational@mstdn.social.

This relies on typing certain codes into your smartphone. I would advise checking that your provider supports these features before going out of your way to show the settings if it doesn't show up. For example, my current provider, Virgin Mobile, requires that you phone them up to enable both features. Meanwhile, others like Lebara have VoLTE enabled by default.

## The guide

To make Voice over LTE show as an option in your phone, you'll need to open your Phone dialler app and type the following key combination: `*#*#86583#*#*`. If it's successful, you'll get a message saying that VoLTE carrier check is disabled.

To make WiFi Calling show as an option in your phone, you'll need to open your Phone dialler app and type the key code: `*#*#869434#*#*`.

If you need to check whether your carrier already has this enabled, input the following code: `*#*#4636#*#*` or use an application that can open up app activities and find the activity 'Phone info'. After that, select your SIM and choose the desired SIM slot. Press the three dots at the bottom and press IMS service status.

## Conclusion

I hope this helped you to make the the VoLTE and VoWiFi settings visible on your Xiaomi device, if it doesn't show up.
