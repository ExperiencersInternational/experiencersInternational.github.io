# Set a data cap on your device

So, you got a data plan? Lots of times, it's expensive for large amounts of data and you want to make sure that you control your data usage. For example, unlimited plans may be as cheap as £16 on an MVNO, but in other countries it can be pretty costly.

This guide will show information for a Xiaomi device and a Windows device.

## Android (Xiaomi)

Again, due to dumb changes between Android skins, this is a MIUI only guide for Android. Please don't blame me for this lol. This has also been working unreliably for me recently, since it's not using the correct reset date.

1. Turn on your device and open up the Security app
2. Press data usage
3. Tap the settings icon on the SIM you want to put a cap on
4. Turn the toggle on for data usage
5. Select data plan
6. Set your monthly data limit (refer to your providers app for how much data you get, e.g. My Virgin Media for Virgin Mobile, My O2 for O2, MyLebara for Lebara, Tesco Mobile for Tesco)
7. Set your usage reset date (bearing in mind this seems to be unreliable) (refer to your providers app)
8. Make sure that when your data is used up that it automatically turns it off
9. Go back and set a data usage warning if you go over a certain amount each day
10. Go back and if you don't think your phone has an accurate reading of what you've used this month, press enter data usage and refer to your providers app
11. You've now implemented a data cap!

## Windows

This guide is designed for Windows 10 and 11, for older versions, I don't think there's as much control over data caps and you can only set metered?

1. Turn on your PC and press Windows+I
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Choose either, WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular depending on what your using
4. Click on Properties for the current network
5. Turn on the switch to set connection as metered
6. Input your required data cap
7. You've set up a data cap!
