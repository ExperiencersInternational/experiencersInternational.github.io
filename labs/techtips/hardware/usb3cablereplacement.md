# Replace your micro USB 3.0 cable for free without buying a new cable

If you've ever used a USB 3.0 micro USB cable, for a hard drive (most of the time), you'll know they work awfully. They're pretty flimsy and break easily, but did you know that if you think your cable is unreliable, you likely have another cable in your house, albeit it will transfer at slower speeds.

## The cable

I assume you all have a USB 2.0 micro USB cable, which can still be flimsy at times but are far more reliable than the USB 3.0 cables. This cable is all you need, and you might be looking at your hard drive thinking that it doesn't fit, but it in fact does. Compared to other cables, micro USB 3.0 looks pretty weird as it looks like there's two parts on the end of the cable, and one of the parts looks identical to the end of a micro USB cable. All you need to do is to plug the end into your hard drive, and the other end to your computer. It is slower than the cable that would have likely come with your hard drive, but you'll be able to rest easily knowing that it works more reliably now.
