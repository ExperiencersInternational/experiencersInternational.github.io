# Clean tracking information from links

A lot of time, at the end of a link you generally end up with a lot of tracking information, and today, I wanted to just a showcase a tool quickly to clean links before sending it to someone.

## Get started

To get started, visit [linkcleaner.app](https://linkcleaner.app/) in a web browser, and install a PWA if prompted to.

You'll notice a box on a page and a arrow next to it. Simply paste any URL that needs cleaning, and then press the arrow. You now have a (hopefully) cleansed link, free of all the tracking stuff.

Sometimes, however, this is not accurate, for example the link https://www.roblox.com/users/profile?username=GamersInternational has no tracking information and yet it gets removed, but it's the risk you have to take with this.
