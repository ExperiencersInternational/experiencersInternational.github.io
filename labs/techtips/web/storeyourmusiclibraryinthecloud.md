# Store your music library in YouTube Music for free

Believe it or not, I have over 13GB of music on my computer, but it's kind of non viable to have this amount on a mobile device or some other devices. Today, I just want to talk about uploading your music manually to YouTube Music to watch ad free and with download support.

By following this guide, you'll be able to watch on your mobile, tablet, desktop, TV and Google Nest devices.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you don't need to go through the process of ripping your music off a CD or anything. It also assumes you already have a Google account. You may need to verify card information with Google, but this was a requirement for the pre YouTube Music system, Google Play Music, it likely isn't needed now, I tried on a new Google account and it wasn't required.

## Key information

- Lyric files is not supported on YouTube Music
- Unlike Google Play Music, you can't edit metadata after uploading or marking as explicit
- The streaming quality of your music will likely be compressed to 140k, which is quite low
- A limit of 10K songs exist
- If you don't have a YouTube Music Premium account, Google Assistant enabled devices like a Google Nest Mini will not play playlists for some dumb reason

## The guide

1. Log in to music.youtube.com on a desktop computer on the account you intend to upload your library to (it works on a mobile device as well as long as you don't go through the app)
2. Press your account icon
3. Press upload music
4. Select the files you want to upload
5. Accept the usage agreement
6. Your music is now in your YouTube Music library

## Conclusion

If you're alright with the significant quality loss (some of my music is in 1700k!), this is an excellent way to store practically all your music for free, and YouTube Music accepts a wide variety of file formats including FLAC and MP3. It still annoys me how you can't ask Google on a Nest device but you can on a smartphone to play a specific playlist. You also don't have to necessarily store music only, I originally learnt about this from either reading an article on WebUser or ComputerActive about this (albeit it was through Play Music), and one of the ideas used there was to add your audiobooks to it, which is a good idea.
