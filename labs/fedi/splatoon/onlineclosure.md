## How to continue playing Wii U or 3DS games online?

I've mentioned it a lot: Pretendo Network.

You'll need a modified Wii U or Nintendo 3DS to access it, you can install custom firmware on these consoles (Aroma/Luma3DS) by following the excellent guides set out at https://wiiu.hacks.guide or https://3ds.hacks.guide. It's not too hard to do and if you need help, people at the Nintendo Homebrew Discord server can help you (or you could even ask some knowledgable people in our Matrix space) if you get help at any point or if you don't feel confident modding your console without supervision.

Once you have got the essentials for custom firmware all set up, follow Pretendo's guides for getting connected on the [Wii U](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/wiiu) or [3DS](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/3ds) pages.

For Wii U, if you want to use your save data, you will need to migrate your save data over with SaveMii. I intend to edit Pretendo's Wii U guide soon to teach people how to use it since I'm not entirely sure myself so people can get all their data over to their Pretendo profiles.

Also, if you're reading this before the servers shut down, do Pretendo a favour and dump data from your console.
