# What the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and 3DS closure on 27/3/23 means for the Splatoon series

I can't write this all up in a single toot, and it's important to outline how it affects the series as a whole.

## Splatoon 1

Splatoon will no longer be available digitally, however you'll still be able to redownload it if you've already purchased it. All updates will remain available to download.

## Other games

### Animal Crossing New Leaf: Welcome Amiibo

Like Splatoon, this won't be available digitally but here's why this game is in this article:

- Obtaining Cece and special Splatoon crossover content

Obviously, you can still get this physically but it's important to note this down.

### Nintendo Badge Arcade

Again, like the previous two, unless you already have downloaded this before, it won't be available digitally, despite being a free title.

Nintendo Badge Arcade has a few badges related to Splatoon, like the Splat Roller. It'll become harder to obtain as well, since you won't be able to pay for extra spins, and you'll have to deal with the 3 given to you each day.
