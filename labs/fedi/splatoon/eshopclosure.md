# What the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and 3DS closure on 27/3/23 means for the Splatoon series

I can't write this all up in a single toot, and it's important to outline how it affects the series as a whole.

## Splatoon 1

Splatoon will no longer be available digitally, however you'll still be able to redownload it if you've already purchased it. All updates will remain available to download.

This game does have a physical release, so you will still be able to get it if you don't have it already, and it will probably be cheaper than the eShop anyways.

## Other games

### Animal Crossing New Leaf: Welcome Amiibo

Like Splatoon, this won't be available digitally but here's why this game is in this article:

- Obtaining Cece and special Splatoon crossover content

Obviously, you can still get this game physically (used pricing is around the same as the digital copy anyways) but it's important to note this down.

### Nintendo Badge Arcade

Again, like the previous two, unless you already have downloaded this before, it won't be available digitally, despite being a free title. There's no physical version of this either, it was only distributed via the eShop.

Nintendo Badge Arcade has a few badges related to Splatoon, like the Splat Roller. It'll become harder to obtain as well, since you won't be able to pay for extra spins, and you'll have to deal with the 3 given to you each day.

### Swapdoodle

Will no longer be downloadable from eShop if you haven't downloaded already. Mainly some DLC with some Splatoon content, like Splatoon Inklings and Things and Splatoon Inkopolis.

### 3DS Theme Shop

Will no longer be purchasable but will still be able to redownload.

Splatoon themes are: Splatoon (Inkredible Theme) and Splatoon (Squid Sisters).

## What this means for preservation

As stated in Nintendo's support article, they basically don't guarantee the ability to redownload forever. If there ever comes a time where your USB stick or SD card gets corrupted and redownloading is no longer available, you're out of luck. If you want to archive your games, I'd highly recommend modding your console, wiiu.hacks.guide and 3ds.hacks.guide is the best places to find information.

**NOTE: In rare cases, modding can brick your console, and you may be banned from online services, although this is unlikely now unless you're hacking. Proceed at your own risk.**
