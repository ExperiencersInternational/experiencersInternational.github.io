# Splatoon Unofficial in different languages

- English: `@splatoon@masto.ai`

Unfortunately, English is the only language we currently have, but we want to expand into different languages, and below is how you can help.

## Translate into a language that you know

Please, DO NOT bother using Google Translate, that's the whole reason why we're working on this translation project in the first place. This requires you to know English, and the language you're translating to.

To start, create an account on the fediverse server of your choice, it does NOT have to be Mastodon, but for consistency, considering using `@splatoon[lang]@masto.ai`, e.g. `@splatoonde@masto.ai` for German. Your accounts title should also state the language it is in for clarity, e.g. 'Splatoon Unofficial DE'.

Then, you should start translating some of the posts written already, just to give yourself a starting point, and finally contact `@splatoon@masto.ai` to add to the list above. If your account is inactive, it may be removed.

Thank you to everyone who does bother translating, it improves accessibility for anyone wanting to get the latest updates, and I know that we do have people who speak languages other than English following Splatoon Unofficial.
