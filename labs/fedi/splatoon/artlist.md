# The Splatoon Unofficial Artists List

Hi squids! This page is literally dedicated to a bunch of artists in the Splatoon community. Consider checking them out and following them! Page is ordered alphabetically.

Also, if any of you squids (and octopi) would like to follow me on my main account, it is `@experiencersinternational@mstdn.social`. Make sure to follow Splatoon Unofficial too and share this list around!
